The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you attempt to access data within a callback function that executes before the asynchronous operation of fetching the data completes.  For example, accessing `snapshot.data().someProperty` before `snapshot.exists` is true can lead to undefined behavior.
